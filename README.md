### Controllabe Table

Controllable Table is a table management software. But in this project, I put google map, and react-d3 trees data representation. 

### for controllable table

1. You can put your desired objects in the table components. And everything will be handled by software. It is that easy. Give it a try.

### for google map part

1. You can attack a specific country by typing their names on the combo-box component. After you select a country, you can see some polylines and robots surrounding that country.

### for react-d3-tree

1. Manager-1 is under CEO, but CEO is under board members. Manager-1 has two assistance, and CEO has ......blah blah. With this, you can just see all the relations betweeen everything in tree diagram representation easily.
